Welcome to the Common Biorepository Model Project!
=====================================

Finding and accessing biospecimens and associated data today is a disintegrated experience. Each institution has its specific biorepository management solution. Basic information about specimen collections is rarely shared or easily searchable. The goal for a Common Biorepository Model (CBM) is to reduce the time and effort required by researchers to locate a biobank that has the specimens they need. The CBM does not seek a full data exchange but to selectively share key information to enable a single search across multiple biobanks. A CBM supports the idea that data should fit a standardized simple domain model as a means to promote sharing. A CBM would define the infrastructure to enable a dynamically updated repository that can be queried as a service. As data is exchanged using CBM, the documentation and quality of biomaterials should by proxy improve. Finally, maintaining a minimal model would support personally identifiable information (PII) compliance. The result is an evolving searchable catalog of basic specimen information that is simple, mutually understood, and community supported.

The Common Biorepository Model is an Open Source project and it is written in Java using caCORE SDK, caCORE CSM, Hibernate, Spring Framework Technologies.
