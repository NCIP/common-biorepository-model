This is the CBM validation test package.  
To execute the tests in this package

- Download Ant 1.7.0 and place it in an accessible location
- Modify the test execution script, run_tests.bat or run_tests.sh to suit your local environment
- Execute the test execution script.  This will execute the suite of the CBM validation tests against the CBM node URL specified in the script.

The tests are organized into the following categories:

CbmConnectivityTests
	These tests test basic connectivity to the CBM node.
	
CbmObjectExistenceTests
	These tests check that the target CBM node contains all of the requisite CBM objects.  A test fails if an expected object is not found.
	Each object is also tested to ensure that its attributes are correct.  A test fails if it is missing an attribute, or contains an extra attribute.
	
CbmCodeListTests
	These tests check the unique values for all attributes in the CBM model that are backed by an enumerated set of valid values.
	A code list test fails if an invalid value is found in an attribute's data.
	
CbmBasicQueryTests
	These tests check that records can be returned for each object.  
	A test fails if an exception is thrown during a query, or if no records can be found for a given object.
	
CbmComplexQueryTests (TO BE WRITTEN)
	These tests check that complex queries, including retrieval of associated objects can be performed.
	A test fails if there is an exception in the query.
