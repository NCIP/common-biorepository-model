Adenocarcinoma is the most common carcinoma in the colon and rectum.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma can be divided in three grades: Grade I (low grade or well-differentiated), grade II (average grade or moderately differentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated).  The following histopathologic features have been shown to be prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis: microacinar versus macroacinar growth pattern, endocrine cells detected by chromogranin immunohistochemistry, Crohn\'s-like reaction and tumor budding.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors).

Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.'),(424,'Blocks','C25436','Refers to preserved specimens embedded in support material.

Formaldehyde is readily soluble in water and is commonly distributed as a 37% solution in water; formalin, a 10% solution of formaldehyde in water, is used as a disinfectant and to preserve biological specimens.
